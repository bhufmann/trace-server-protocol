# Trace Server Protocol Flows
This repository collects execution flows for applications using the [Trace Server Protocol (TSP)](https://github.com/theia-ide/trace-server-protocol). This is complementary to the TSP and explains how data are exchanged between client and server and how users interact with the application. 

The sequence diagrams are explained using "Theia Trace" as client example and it's refering to [Theia Trace Extension](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension). 

The sequence diagrams are written for [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). Install a PlantUML editor to your favorite editor to see the sequence diagrams.
